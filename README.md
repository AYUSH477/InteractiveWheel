Lauz-Hack Project: Interactive 3d wheel
What it does: Helps users control 3d videos using a touch-sensitive Logitech Crown.

How I built it: Using networking (Chrome Extensions) and programming (JavaScript)

Challenges I ran into: Linking errors, Slow tracking of the videos

Accomplishments that I'm proud of: We wrote a new functionality that can be useful for Logitech's Crown Keyboard product.

What I learned: C programming, linking libraries, networking, JavaScript, Chrome Extensions, acoustics, ALSA drivers
